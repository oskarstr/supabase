# Handoff Summary · 2025-10-17 · codex

## Current Focus
- Finish the shared permission matrix deliverable (publishable artifact + backend docs) so Studio can consume it when ready, and keep the hardened bootstrap flow documented for future changes.

## What’s Done
- Hardened admin bootstrap: `seedDefaults` now retries GoTrue provisioning, reconciles duplicate profiles/memberships back to id 1, and ships with regression coverage (`tests/auth.bootstrap.test.ts`).
- Normalised member role handling: `upsertOrganizationMemberRole` and invitation acceptance now merge roles/metadata instead of overwriting them; new tests cover multi-role assignments and canonical `role_scoped_projects`.
- Kept the plan/handoff docs current so Phase 2/4 are marked complete and remaining work is scoped to matrix governance + client matching.

## What’s Next
1. Publish a reusable permission matrix artifact (package/JSON) so Studio and other clients can import it. We are not planning to edit Studio ourselves, but documenting the artifact keeps future Studio work straightforward while the backend continues to tolerate the existing regex matcher.
2. Finish the Phase 6 doc pass (bootstrap flow, membership metadata contract, test strategy) and clean up any TODOs.

## Repo Hygiene & Tests
- Quick checks: `pnpm --filter platform-api exec vitest run tests/permissions.test.ts` and `pnpm --filter platform-api exec vitest run tests/organization.members.test.ts`.
- Keep commit messages in the format `Profile & Memberships API: …` (no `feat/chore` prefixes).
- When adding dependencies, remember to update `pnpm-lock.yaml` with `pnpm install --filter platform-api --no-frozen-lockfile`.

## User Quirks & Expectations
- Commit messages: no conventional prefixes; prefer `Area: summary`.
- Code should be “artful”: clean, well-factored, no shortcuts even in tests. If a validation is “good enough,” it probably isn’t—pull in the proper helper/library.
- Tests should challenge the code. Don’t tweak assertions to make them pass; fix the implementation instead.
- Keep `.agent/analysis/auth-hardening-plan.md` updated as you land work.

## Follow-up Hardening Items (2025-10-17)
- **Admin bootstrap skip path** – warning only today; add a reconciliation hook for environments that enable GoTrue later.
- **Duplicate reconciliation timing** – invitations now migrate, but audit logs/project runtimes still need review.
- **Role metadata hygiene** – prune stale `role_scoped_projects` entries when invitations or roles are removed.
- **Retry defaults for tests** – consider exposing retry toggles via the new test helpers for pg-mem scenarios.
- **Permission matrix governance** – publish the shared artifact; Studio adoption can happen later by whoever maintains that repo.
- **Permission matching** – backend accepts both regex and matrix lookups, so Studio can switch independently.

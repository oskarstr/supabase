# Handoff Summary · 2025-10-17 · codex

## Current Focus
- Wrap Phase 6: finish the documentation/cleanup sweep (TODO removal, route inventory validation) now that the auth overview and matrix notes are in place.

## What’s Done
- Hardened admin bootstrap: `seedDefaults` now retries GoTrue provisioning, reconciles duplicate profiles/memberships back to id 1, and ships with regression coverage (`tests/auth.bootstrap.test.ts`).
- Normalised member role handling: `upsertOrganizationMemberRole` and invitation acceptance now merge roles/metadata instead of overwriting them; new tests cover multi-role assignments and canonical `role_scoped_projects`.
- Kept the plan/handoff docs current so Phase 2/4 are marked complete and remaining work is scoped to matrix governance + client matching.
- Published a shared `shared-data/permission-matrix` artifact and updated platform-api to hydrate its matrix from that single source, clearing the path for Studio consumption.
- Added `scripts/platform-api/smoke-auth.mts` to hit the live `/api/platform/auth/{ref}/…` surface (create/update/delete user, invite/send flows, spam validation) with service-role credentials.
- Matched Studio’s MFA factor removal route by iterating through `auth.admin.mfa.deleteFactor` when GoTrue rejects the bulk endpoint; smoke test now authenticates with the seeded admin session to surface real permission issues.

## What’s Next
1. Reconcile `scripts/platform-api/list-expected-routes.mjs` with the Fastify surface now that the `/platform/auth/{ref}/…` proxies exist; call out any lingering gaps (e.g., analytics log-drain routes).
2. Finish the Phase 6 cleanup sweep: retire TODOs/hacks introduced during auth hardening and refresh the docs/plan once the route inventory matches reality.

## Repo Hygiene & Tests
- Quick checks: `pnpm --filter platform-api exec vitest run tests/permissions.test.ts` and `pnpm --filter platform-api exec vitest run tests/organization.members.test.ts`.
- Keep commit messages in the format `Profile & Memberships API: …` (no `feat/chore` prefixes).
- When adding dependencies, remember to update `pnpm-lock.yaml` with `pnpm install --filter platform-api --no-frozen-lockfile`.

## User Quirks & Expectations
- Commit messages: no conventional prefixes; prefer `Area: summary`.
- Code should be “artful”: clean, well-factored, no shortcuts even in tests. If a validation is “good enough,” it probably isn’t—pull in the proper helper/library.
- Tests should challenge the code. Don’t tweak assertions to make them pass; fix the implementation instead.
- Keep `.agent/analysis/auth-hardening-plan.md` updated as you land work.

## Follow-up Hardening Items (2025-10-17)
- **Admin bootstrap skip path** – warning only today; add a reconciliation hook for environments that enable GoTrue later.
- **Duplicate reconciliation timing** – invitations now migrate, but audit logs/project runtimes still need review.
- **Role metadata hygiene** – prune stale `role_scoped_projects` entries when invitations or roles are removed.
- **Retry defaults for tests** – consider exposing retry toggles via the new test helpers for pg-mem scenarios.
- **Permission matrix governance** – publish the shared artifact; Studio adoption can happen later by whoever maintains that repo.
- **Permission matching** – backend accepts both regex and matrix lookups, so Studio can switch independently.

Ping the user if you notice anything “hacky” or unfinished before moving on. They prefer blunt honesty over politeness.
